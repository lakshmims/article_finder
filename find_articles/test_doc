Hillary Clinton said she was “eager” to be interviewed by the FBI this weekend regarding the agency’s investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state, though she declined to say who said the setup was legal and whether it violated government regulations regarding the handling of classified material.

Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, was interviewed Saturday morning at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.

Her campaign said the interview was voluntary and lasted three-and-a-half hours.

“It was something I had offered to do since last August,” Clinton told MSNBC in a phone interview Saturday evening. “I've been eager to do it, and I was pleased to have the opportunity to assist the department in bringing its review to a conclusion.
